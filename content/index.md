Looks like you found Prateek's WIP blog landing page. 🛬

Prateek is a Frontend Engineer and an iOS developer, currently building [Fold](https://fold.money) and [Devfolio](https://devfolio.co).
Apart from his unconditional love for JavaScript and React, he also enjoys watching Marvel movies 🎥  and playing quirky games on his phone 📱.

He sometimes likes writing 📝 the stuff he has learned through his journey here.

While he builds this page, why not check out some of his latest posts.
